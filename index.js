    üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
    ## Badges
    ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)
    Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
    ## Features
    If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
    ## How to Contribute
    If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
    ## Tests
    Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.`;
